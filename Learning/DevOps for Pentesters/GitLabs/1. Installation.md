GitLab publish official Linux packages for easy install on Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSUSE and more.  In the process of writing this course, I used Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS.

First, make sure that the system is up to date:
```bash
rasta@gitlab:~$ sudo apt update
```

The necessary pre-requisites are likely already installed, but if not:
```bash
rasta@gitlab:~$ sudo apt install -y curl openssh-server ca-certificates tzdata perl
```

Setup the official GitLab repository:
```bash
rasta@gitlab:~$ curl https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ee/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
The repository is setup! You can now install packages.
```

Then finally, install the GitLab package:
```bash
rasta@gitlab:~$ sudo EXTERNAL_URL="http://172.23.157.233" apt install gitlab-ee
```

Thank you for installing GitLab!
GitLab should be available at http://172.23.157.233

##### Note that `172.23.157.233` is the IP address of my Ubuntu VM, but you should use whatever your VM has.  If you're doing this inside a proper environment that has DNS, then you can use a hostname instead.  You can also use SSL if you want to go down that route, but it's not relevant to this course.

The default administrator password is written into a log file, which you will need to retrieve before it's automatically deleted.
```bash
rasta@gitlab:~$ sudo cat /etc/gitlab/initial_root_password

Password: 1ExnLsfbkxSKxwl3KavRl5Zmn3Ot2LtHl4dMl+lZTEs=
```

You will now be able to login with the username root and password above.
