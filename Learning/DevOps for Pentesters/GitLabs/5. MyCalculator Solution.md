We're now writing and committing code like a developer.  The following assumes that you have [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) installed on a machine acting as your "developer workstation".  I'm using .NET 6 and PowerShell Core on Windows, but since these are both cross-platform, you can use whichever OS you like.

First, clone the empty project.
```powershell
PS C:\Tools> git clone http://172.23.157.233/rasta/mycalculator.git

Cloning into 'mycalculator'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
```

Move into the new directory and switch to the main branch.
```powershell
PS C:\Tools> cd .\mycalculator\

PS C:\Tools\mycalculator> git switch -c main
Switched to a new branch 'main'
```

Create a new dotnet solution.
```powershell
PS C:\Tools> dotnet new sln
The template "Solution File" was created successfully.

PS C:\Tools\mycalculator> ls

Directory: C:\Tools\mycalculator

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name

-a---          14/11/2022    14:35            441 mycalculator.sln
```

Now we can commit that change and push it back to GitLab.
```powershell
PS C:\Tools\mycalculator> git add .
PS C:\Tools\mycalculator> git commit -m "create solution"
[main (root-commit) da41cea] create solution
