We're now done with the default root user, so we can create our own standard user to work from.  Go to **Admin > Users** and click **New User**.

We didn't configure SMTP on the GitLab server, so we can't receive the email for setting the account password.  As a workaround, after creating the user account, click **Edit** and you can set a temporary password.

Logout as the root user and login as the new user with the temporary password.  You'll then be prompted to set a new password.
