I'm going to install TeamCity on Windows Server, as this is way easier when it comes to building .NET Framework projects.  Download and run the [TeamCity.exe](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows) installer.  The process can be as simple as next, next, next.

The default installation directory is `C:\TeamCity`.  You will almost certainly want to add an exclusion in Defender for this directory, so that it doesn't start deleting our builds.

Like GitLab, TeamCity supports distributed build agents (which are also cross-platform).  For simplicity, we'll run both the Build Agent and TeamCity server on the same machine.

The default port to access the TeamCity management UI is `8111`.  The installer will automatically add inbound firewall rules.

Both the TeamCity server and build agent run as Services, which can of course, run as a dedicated local (or domain user) or SYSTEM.  For simplicity, I'll run both as SYSTEM.

After the installation has completed, a build agent properties window will appear.

We don't need to change anything, so just click **Save**.

You can now access `http://<TeamCity IP>:8111` in a browser and you'll be greeted with the first start wizard.  Again, in a production environment, you can customise all these based on your needs.

Leave the data directory as default and select the Internal (HSQLDB) database connection.

Accept the License Agreement and untick "Send anonymous usage statistics".

Finally, create an Administrator account and you'll be redirected to the main home page.

Before we go any further, there are some additional dependencies that we need to install.

The first is [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) (because as with GitLab Runners, the TeamCity build agents checkout code via `git`).

The second is the .NET Framework 4 and 4.5 targeting packs.  Annoyingly, Microsoft have removed these from [dotnet.microsoft.com](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net40) because they're no longer supported.  The path of least resistance is to install the .NET Desktop Workload and targeting packs from [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/).
