It would be a useful step to publish artifacts somewhere outside of TeamCity for easy access during an engagement - such as a central file share that can be accessed remotely over a VPN or other solution.  To achieve this, you can add yet another build step and use either the FTP, SMB, or SSH Upload runner depending on your environment and needs.

You may have noticed by now that each build step has an **Execute step** option, which by default is **If all previous steps finished successfully**.  You can change this step to **Only if build status is successful** to avoid pushing failed artifacts.
