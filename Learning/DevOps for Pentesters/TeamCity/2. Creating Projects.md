Projects in TeamCity are created from existing code repositories, primarily via a URL.  These can be public URLs (e.g., public GitHub repos) or private URLs (e.g., your private GitLab repos).

Click **create project**, **select from a repository URL,** enter [https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus.git](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus.git) and click **Proceed**.

On the next screen, the **Default branch** specifies the main branch to be monitored by TeamCity.  By default, it will poll the repo every 60 seconds and pull down any code changes that may have occurred (which will also automatically trigger a new build).  There may be scenarios where you want to change this, for instance if you want the latest and greatest code from a repo that isn't officially stable or merged into the main branch.

The **Branch specification** field allows you to specify any additional branches you want to pull in.  The wildcard means that any and all branches will be pulled, including any development, test and feature branches.  Code changes to any of those branches will also trigger new builds.  You probably don't want or need this, so delete the text within this box so that only the default branch is monitored.  Click **Proceed** again.

TeamCity will automatically suggest the appropriate build step(s) based on the project type.  In this case, it will likely suggest two options - building with the dotnet CLI or with MSBuild.  We don't have .NET installed, so choose the **MSBuild** option instead.

This is a good starting point, but we want to make some modifications, so click **Edit**.

Under the **MSBuild Version**, select **MSBuild Tools 2019** from the dropdown**.**  Next to the **Configuration** text box, click the little wand icon and select **Release**.

Finally, click **Save**.

Under **General Settings** (in the left-hand menu) **> Artifact Paths**, we need to tell TeamCity what artifact(s) we expect out of the project.  In this case, we're expecting `Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe`, so simply copy that into the text box.

We're now ready to run our first build - click **Run** in the top-right of the window.

The build should succeed, and you'll see `Rubeus.exe` available under **Artifacts**.
