# Priority 

Ansible can make use of a config file to use as reference to how it should operate

The lowest priority is the `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` default config when ansible is installed via system install (i.e. `apt install ansible`)

If this config file is not present, you can manually create it which ansible will use automatically
```bash
su -
mkdir /etc/ansible/
touch /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
exit
ansible --version
```

The next highest priority is `~/.ansible.cfg` a hidden file in the users home directory. This file is only present if the user creates it.
```bash
cd ~
touch .ansible.cfg
ansible.cfg
```

Next highest priority is `./ansible.cfg` which lives in the current directory. It allows for easy control and structure to have separate `.cfg` in different places to execute different tasks.
```bash
mkdir testdir1
touch testdir1/ansible.cfg
cd testdir1/
ansible --version

cd ..

mkdir testdir2
touch testdir2/ansible.cfg
cd testdir2/
ansible --version
```

The top highest priority configuration file is `ANSIBLE_CONFIG` environment variable which would point to the config file
```bash
touch example_ansible.cfg
export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/home/ansible/example_ansible.cfg
ansible --version
unset ANSIBLE_CONFIG
```
