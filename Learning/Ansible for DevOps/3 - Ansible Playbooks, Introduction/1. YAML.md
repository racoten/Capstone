YAML files should always start with 3 `-` symbols and always end with 3 `.` symbols to adhere to writing standards.

The following python one-liner should read a YAML file and display it as a JSON string:
```bash
python3 -c 'import yaml,pprint;pprint.pprint(yaml.load(open("test.yaml").read(), Loader=yaml.FullLoader))'
```

We can test this running it:
```bash
./show_ansible_python.sh
```

With an example file `test.yaml`

We can now treat it as a dictionary as well and use it with python:

# Strings

We really don't need to specify quotes to denote strings in YAML since python would still interpret it as such and it can be of use for a dictionary:

![[Pasted image 20230809202404.png]]

# Escape Characters

The problem comes when using escape characters. Python can only recognize escape characters when a string is inside a double quote:

# Multiline String

In YAML, we can define a multiline string using the `|` pipe character symbol after a colon like so:
```yaml
example: | 
	this is a string
	this goes over
	multiple line
```

And python is able to recognize multilines in YAML and will setup a dictionary with the correct escape character:

![[Pasted image 20230809202842.png]]

The `>` symbol specifies a string that can be formatted as multiple lines in YAML:
```yaml
example: >
	this is a string
	this goes over
	multiple line
```

Python will treat this as a single line and will add the `\n` escape character at the end:

![[Pasted image 20230809203133.png]]

The `-` symbol after the `>` symbol, will remove the last character in the string. In this case, it will remove the `\n`:
```yaml
example: >-
	this is a string
	this goes over
	multiple line
```

# Integers

YAML has neat integration for integers in that it will recognize and derive one.

Python will also treat it as an integer:

![[Pasted image 20230809203557.png]]

If you double quote the value, it will treat it as a string instead of an integer.

# Booleans

YAML also has support for boolean values even with alternate methods to define one:

![[Pasted image 20230809203806.png]]

Python will not recognize the `n` and `y` but we can programmatically derive the boolean value to recognize which is if it's true or false.

# Other Data Structures

In YAML, we can also define a list of items. Said items can be convert it to a Python list in which can be used to perform lookups:

![[Pasted image 20230809204249.png]]

# User-Defined Dictionary

We can also define our own dictionaries like so:
```yaml
{example_key_1: example_value_1, example_key_2: example_value_2}
```

![[Pasted image 20230809204552.png]]

The same goes for list:

![[Pasted image 20230809204640.png]]

# Bad Structure

It is invalid to define a key/value and a list item in the same code block:
```yaml
example_key_1: example_value_1
- example_list_entry_1
```

![[Pasted image 20230809204843.png]]

The same also goes for in-line definitions:

![[Pasted image 20230809204932.png]]

# Nested Data Structures

We can create nested dictionaries like so:
```yaml
example_key_1:
  sub_example_key1: sub_example_value1

example_key_2:
  sub_example_key2: sub_example_value2
```

This can be interpreted by python as well:

![[Pasted image 20230809205903.png]]

We can also create nested dictionaries each with a list of items like so:
```yaml
example_1: 
  - item_1
  - item_2
  - item_3

example_2: 
  - item_4
  - item_5
  - item_6
```

# Further Down the Rabbit Hole

Because YAML is so data-oriented, we can go beyond and have even more nested data structures on top of one another:
```yaml
example_dictionary_1:
  - example_dictionary_2:
    - 1
    - 2
    - 3
  - example_dictionary_3:
    - 4
    - 5
    - 6
  - example_dictionary_4:
    - 7
    - 8
    - 9
```

Python will correctly derive this as so:

# Challenge

- Create an empty `test.yaml` file and test it with the python one-liner
- Create a list of Car Manufacturers:
	- Aston Martin
	- Fiat
	- Ford
	- Vauxhall
- Change each of these entries to dictionaries
- Add key values to each one:
	- year_founded
	- website
- Add a key of founded_by, but with a list of founder or founders
