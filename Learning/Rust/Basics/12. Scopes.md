# 12. Scopes

Variables only exist and are accessible within a given scope hierarchy.  A scope is created any time the curly braces, `{ }` are used.  That means every loop, function and closure has their own scope.  I used the word hierarchy, because as we've seen with loops and closures, some scopes can exist inside other scopes.

Variable accessibility is relatively simple in these cases.  Anything declared in an "outer" scope is accessible from an "inner" scope.  This must be possible, otherwise loops would not function.  However, variables declared within an "inner" scope cannot be accessed in an "outer" scope.

For example, the following code will throw the error "cannot find value `foo` in this scope" and will not compile.
