# 11. Closures

At a basic level, a closure is a function that doesn't have a name and is declared inline within an existing function.  Closures are declared using two pipes, `||` followed by curly braces.

```rust
fn main() {  
    || {  
          
    };  
}
```

To actually execute code in a closure, it needs to be assigned to a variable which can then be called.

```rust
fn main() {  
    let closure = || {  
        println!("Hello from closure");  
    };  
  
    closure();  
}
```

We can also declare input parameters for a closure, by adding them between the two pipes.

```rust
fn main() {  
    let closure = |message: &str| {  
        println!("{}", message);  
    };  
  
    closure("Hello World");  
}
```

Finally, data can be returned from a closure by declaring the return data type after the pipes.

```rust
fn main() {  
    let closure = |name: &str| -> String {  
        format!("Hello, {}", name)  
    };  
  
    let message = closure("Rasta");  
    println!("{}", message);  
}
```

Closures may seem a bit silly, but we'll see how they can be leveraged with threads in the **Concurrency** module.
