# 1. Setup and Configuration

To create a new Rust project in CLion, click **New Project** on the welcome screen and choose **Rust** from the language types on the left.

The toolchain location, version and standard library should be automatically detected.  Leave the project template set to **Binary** and click **Create**.

The layout of the project should be fairly familiar if you've done any programming work in an IDE before.  `Cargo.toml` is a manifest file which defines the name and version of our project, as well as any dependencies that it has.  `main.rs` is the only source code file which contains the boilerplate "hello world" code.

The `fn` keyword is used to define a function.  Each function has a name - in this case `main`.  This is a special function which acts as the application's entry point.  The name "main" is standard across other languages such as C and C#.

Every function has a set of parenthesis `( )` after the name, which define any arguments that should be passed to it.  In this case there aren't any, but we'll see examples of it later.  The opening and closing curly braces `{ }` simply define where the function code starts and ends.

The bang (or exclamation point) `!` after `println` denotes that we're calling a macro, rather than another function.  Macros in Rust are a form of metaprogramming, which we won't be covering in this course.  C programmers will be familiar with macros, but Rust macros work entirely different than those in C.

The fastest way to run the project is to use `cargo`.  Cargo is the Rust's package manager which is used to manage dependencies in your project, but it can also create and build Rust projects.  Press **Alt+F12** in CLion, or go to **View > Tool Windows > Terminal**.  Then type `cargo run` and hit **Enter**.

The code will compile and execute, printing "Hello, world!" to the console.

We'll see other ways in which projects can be built and debugged later in this course.
