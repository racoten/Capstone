# 22. Capstone

## To-do List Application

The capstone project is to create a to-do list application using all the knowledge and skills presented throughout this course.

A to-do item should contain at least a:

-   Short title/headline.
-   Detailed body/description.

The application should prompt the user to:

-   Add a new to-do item.
-   List the title/headline of every to-do item.
-   Display the body of a specific to-do item.
-   Delete a to-do item.

You may optionally add any additional features you like, such as priority (e.g. urgent), status (e.g. not started/started/complete), and due date. Â To get the maximum value from the final project, it will ideally have module, console, and unit tests components.
