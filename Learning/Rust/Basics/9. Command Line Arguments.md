# 9. Command Line Arguments

You may need an application capable of reading arguments in from the command line.  This can be done via `std::env::args` from the Rust standard library.  Because you don't know how many arguments they'll be, read them in as a vector.

```rust
use std::env::args;  
  
fn main() {  
    let args: Vec<String> = args().collect();  
    for arg in args.iter() {  
        println!("{}", arg);  
    }  
}
```

Note that the application's path is always passed in as the first argument, 0, and user-supplied arguments come after, 1..n.  If your application has mandatory arguments, it's common to do a length check and exit from the program if not enough are provided.

```rust
use std::env::args;  
  
fn main() {  
    let args: Vec<String> = args().collect();  
    if args.len() < 3 {  
        println!("Not enough arguments");  
        show_usage();  
        return    }  
}  
  
fn show_usage() {  
    println!("Usage: app.exe <arg1> arg2>");  
}
```
