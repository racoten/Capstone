# 8. Functions

A function is a block of code that you can call one or more times.  Up until now, the only function we've worked with is `main`.

```rust
fn main() {  
  
}
```

As we said at the beginning of the course, a function is defined using the `fn` keyword, followed by a name.  The opening and closing curly braces define the start and end of the function.  Functions can also accept input parameters and return data.  Main does neither of those, so let's create a new function to add two integers together.

Input parameters are placed inside the parenthesise.  The syntax is parameter name, colon, and the data type.  Multiple parameters are separated by a comma.  To pass in two unsigned 8-bit integers:

```rust
fn add_integers(i1: u8, i2: u8) {  
      
}
```

We also want our function to return the result of the calculation.  To do this, we define the return data type just before the opening curly brace, using an arrow, `->`.  Adding two u8's will just return another u8.

```rust
fn add_integers(i1: u8, i2: u8) -> u8{  
  
}
```

CLion (and most other IDEs) will now highlight an error under the closing curly brace of the function.  It's basically telling us that the function is not returning the correct data type (which is obvious because we haven't written its code yet).

Most languages use the `return` keyword, like:

```rust
fn add_integers(i1: u8, i2: u8) -> u8{  
    let result = i1 + i2;  
    return result;  
}
```

Depending on your style, you could shorten this to `return i1 + i2;`.

However, the preferred style in Rust is to drop both the return and the end semi-colon so that it looks like this:

```rust
fn add_integers(i1: u8, i2: u8) -> u8{  
    i1 + i2  
}
```

With our function defined, we can call it multiple times from main.

```rust
fn main() {  
    for i in 0..5 {  
        let result = add_integers(i, i);  
        println!("{} + {} = {}", i, i, result);  
    }  
}  
  
fn add_integers(i1: u8, i2: u8) -> u8{  
    i1 + i2  
}
```
