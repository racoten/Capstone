The `spawn` command will spawn an x86 or x64 process and inject shellcode for the specified listener into it.

In this example, I have a DNS Beacon checking in from bfarmer every 1 minute.  Instead of operating through this Beacon, I want to leave it open as a lifeline on a slow check-in.  In which case, I can spawn a new HTTP session and work from there instead.
