Once elevated on a machine, we can obtain credential material for other users who are authenticated.  Credentials can come in the form of plaintext (username & password), hashes (NTLM, AES, DCC, NetNTLM, etc), and Kerberos tickets.  This chapter will review how to dump creds in various formats.  The **User Impersonation** chapter will show how these different credential formats can be leveraged.
