Group Policy is the central repository in a forest or domain that controls the configuration of computers and users.  Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are sets of configurations that are applied to Organisational Units (OUs).  By default, only Domain Admins can create GPOs and link them to OUs, but it's common practice to delegate those rights to other teams.  This delegation is typically assigned to domain groups - for example, a "Workstation Admins" group may have rights to manage GPOs that apply to a "Workstation" OU.  These can create privilege escalation opportunities by allowing user to apply malicious GPOs to domain admin users or their computers.
