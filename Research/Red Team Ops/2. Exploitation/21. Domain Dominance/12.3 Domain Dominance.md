Once an attacker achieves a very high level of privilege in the domain, such as Domain or Enterprise Admin, it's very difficult for a defending organisation to recover or even consider the forest as "clean" again.  Attackers with this access can extract credential material from the domain and use it to re-obtain DA-level access at any time.  The majority of these credentials are never changed, which grants practically unlimited access.

If you've ever seen this joke before, well… it's true.
