In the previous host persistence chapter, we looked at obtaining persistence in the context of a user.  However, after we've elevated our privileges on a host, we can also add persistence mechanisms to maintain SYSTEM access.  This allows to maintain elevated access to a machine without having to exploit a vulnerability again (because it may be patched or fixed at a later date).

For these methods to work, you must be running in a high integrity Beacon.

  Remember that SYSTEM processes cannot authenticate to the web proxy, so we can't use HTTP Beacons.  Use P2P or DNS Beacons instead.
