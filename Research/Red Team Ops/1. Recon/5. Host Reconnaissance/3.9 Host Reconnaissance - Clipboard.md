The `clipboard` command will capture any text from the user's clipboard (it does not capture images or any other types of data). Â This can be handy for capturing credentials that are being copy/pasted, which can be especially prevalent when password managers are in use.

This is a one-off command (it does not run as a job) and dumps the content directly to the Beacon console.
