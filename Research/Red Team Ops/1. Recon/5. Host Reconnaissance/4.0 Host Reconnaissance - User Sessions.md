Users that are currently logged on to this same machine may be good targets to attack.  If they are more privileged than our current user in the domain, they may be a good candidate for lateral movement to other machines.  The **Domain Reconnaissance** chapter will show methods for performing this type of enumeration.

The `net logons` command will list the logon sessions on this machine.
```
beacon> net logons

Logged on users at \\localhost:

DEV\bfarmer
DEV\jking
DEV\WKSTN-2$
