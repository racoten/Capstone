Even though dropping files to disk has a bad reputation, there are instances where it's fairly unavoidable if we want to use certain tactics. Â For instance, we can show we have access to the File Server, but we can't PsExec to it because the service binary payload is being detected by Defender.

Operation did not complete successfully because the file contains a virus or potentially unwanted software.

If we copy the payload to our local desktop and check the associated log, we can see that the "file" was detected.
