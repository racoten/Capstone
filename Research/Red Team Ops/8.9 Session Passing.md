As we know in Cobalt Strike (and many other C2 frameworks), payloads are tied very closely to listeners.  Session passing is a process where you spawn a new C2 session from one payload/listener type to another.  For example, we could have a long-haul Beacon checking in over DNS, which we can use to spawn a different short-haul Beacon over HTTP.  It's also possible to pass sessions between completely different C2 frameworks, such as spawning a Meterpreter session from Beacon.

This is useful for several reasons, including:

- Leverage a capability within a framework that Cobalt Strike doesn't have.
- Use different C2 frameworks as backup access in the event the current access is lost.
- To emulate specific TTPs.
