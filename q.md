**General Question 1: Do you often receive emails or text messages from unknown sources?**

**Recommendation for GQ1:** Always be cautious about unexpected or unsolicited communications. If you do not recognize the sender or if something seems off, it is best not to open the email or click on any links. Keep your email filters updated to help block potential spam.

**Targeted Questions and Recommendations for GQ1:**

1. **TQ1.1:** Have you ever received an email from an unknown source asking you to confirm your personal details or passwords?
- **Recommendation:** Never provide your personal information in response to an unsolicited email. Legitimate companies and institutions will never ask for your sensitive data via email.
2. **TQ1.2:** Have you ever received an SMS from an unknown number containing a link to a website?
- **Recommendation:** Avoid clicking on links from unknown numbers. If the SMS claims to be from a familiar organization, manually type the official website into your browser instead of clicking the link.
3. **TQ1.3:** Did you ever receive an email that seemed to be from a known contact, but the email address was different or the message seemed unusual?
- **Recommendation:** Verify suspicious emails with the supposed sender via another communication method. Cybercriminals can pose as people you know to trick you into revealing sensitive information.
4. **TQ1.4:** Have you received an email or text message notifying you about a too-good-to-be-true offer (like a lottery win, unexpected gift, or a fantastic job offer)?
- **Recommendation:** Be skeptical of offers that seem too good to be true. They often are. Always validate such offers by contacting the company or checking their official website directly.

**General Question 2: Do you verify the legitimacy of websites before entering your personal information?**

**Recommendation for GQ2:** Always ensure that you are on a secure, legitimate website before entering any personal information. Look for 'https://' at the start of the URL and a lock symbol in the address bar.

**Targeted Questions and Recommendations for GQ2:**

1. **TQ2.1:** Before logging in or providing personal information, do you check if the website uses a secure connection (https://)?
- **Recommendation:** Always look for 'https://' in the website URL before entering any sensitive information. This signifies that the website has an SSL certificate, encrypting the data between you and the site.
2. **TQ2.2:** Do you double-check the URL of the websites to ensure they are spelled correctly and are the official sites they claim to be?
- **Recommendation:** Always verify the spelling of the URL. Phishing websites often use misspelled versions of popular websites or replace a few characters to trick you.
1. **TQ2.3:** When redirected to a website via email or text message, do you manually enter the official website URL into the browser instead of clicking the link?
- **Recommendation:** Whenever possible, avoid clicking on links in emails and text messages. Instead, manually type the known, official website address into your browser.
4. **TQ2.4:** Do you look for signs of website legitimacy such as contact information, privacy policy, and proper grammar and spelling?
- **Recommendation:** Always look for signs of legitimacy on a website. Poor grammar, lack of company information, and missing privacy policies may all be indicators of a phishing site.
