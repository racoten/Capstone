**Backlog Items for Implementation:**

## Implant

- Exploitation of Zero-day Vulnerabilities: Research and implement techniques to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities for testing and demonstration purposes.
- Data Exfiltration Methods: Enhance data exfiltration capabilities with additional covert channels, such as HTTP-based exfiltration and DNS tunneling.
- Privilege Escalation Exploits: Implement advanced techniques to escalate privileges on the target system, aiming for higher access levels.

## Server

- Multi-User Support: Implement user management functionality, allowing multiple users with different roles to access the platform.
- Automated Response and Remediation Actions: Integrate automated response actions, such as blocking, quarantining, or isolating compromised systems based on predefined rules.
- Reporting and Alerting for Suspicious Activities: Develop reporting and alerting mechanisms to notify administrators of potential security incidents or unusual activities.

## Interface

- Real-time Implant Monitoring and Reporting: Enhance real-time monitoring features to provide more detailed insights into implant activities and system interactions.
