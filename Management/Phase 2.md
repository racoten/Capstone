# Sprint Execution (September 9 - November 15, 2023)

**Backlog Items for Implementation:**

## Implant

- Advanced Evasion Techniques:
	- Module Stomping: Implement a technique to modify or delete specific modules from the target system to evade detection.
	- Reflective DLL Injection: Develop a method to inject dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) into the target process without relying on traditional injection techniques.
	- PE Loading: Implement techniques to load and execute Portable Executable (PE) files in-memory to avoid writing files to disk.
	- Fileless Execution Techniques: Extend the implant's capabilities to execute commands and payloads in-memory without leaving traces on disk.
- C2 Communication Encryption: Implement encryption for communication between the implant and the server to secure data and evade network-based detection.
- Anti-Debugging Techniques: Develop techniques to detect and evade debugging attempts, making it more difficult for analysts to reverse engineer the implant.

## Server

- Authorization: Implement a robust authentication and authorization mechanism to control access to the server and its functionalities.
- Load Balancing for Multiple Implant Connections: Develop load balancing capabilities to distribute incoming connections from multiple implants across available resources efficiently.
- GeoIP-Based Routing of Implant Connections: Add the ability to route connections based on the geolocation of the implants to improve performance and evade detection.

## Interface

- Tab for Implant Setting Customization: Create a dedicated tab to allow users to customize various settings and configurations of the implants.
- Tab for Security Customization: Provide options for users to modify security-related settings to adapt to different target environments and threat scenarios.
- Integration with Threat Intelligence Feeds: Enable integration with external threat intelligence feeds to enhance the platform's capabilities for threat hunting and detection.

## Hardware

- Customize to Download Implant Code: Configure the ESP32 hardware to enable downloading and executing the implant code on the target system.
